## Getting Started

- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
- Add 2 files (each one in a separate commit):
    - A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
    - A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
- Open a pull request.


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
